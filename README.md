# R4EPIs logo


This repository contains the official R4epis logo for this project. 

A bit about the logo itself:

 - R and epis are self explanatory.
 - The 4 looking both ways is for looking backwards (STATA) and forwards (R)
 - The dots represent disease tracking

------

There are a few different versions of the logo:

![Black and white logo (RGB)](screen/R4epis_b_w_rgb.png)

![Color logo (RGB)](screen/R4epis_clr_rgb.png)

<img src="screen/R4epis_dark_black_rgb.png" alt="Black and white logo for dark background" style="color:black" />

For print media, there are eps versions of the logo located in the [print/](print)
directory.
